### ACCEPT

`ACCEPT` allows the seller to accpet the best bid price at a time. The `ACCEPT` button is located under the `CREATED` tab for your owned tokens on the profile page. The `ACCEPT` button becomes clickable when there is a bid price for the auction, and the auction time has expired. The seller receives the highest bid amount from the escrow account and the winning buyer will receive the NFT from the escrow account.
