### Usage

The `Update` button is placed under the `OWNED` tab on the profile page. Clicking the `Update` button allows you to update the tokens owned and minted in the CollectiVerse. An optional box is provided for inputting the NFT address from which you want to import tokens minted from an external source. Owned tokens are not loaded automatically but manually by clicking the `Update` button

### Caution

Due to the limitation of retrieving event logs 1000 blocks at a time using the json-rpc of the topos testnet's public chain, the performance is currently suboptimal. When you click the `Update` button, the process begins; however, if you perform another action without waiting for Metamask to respond, there is a potential risk of encountering errors in Metamask operations.
