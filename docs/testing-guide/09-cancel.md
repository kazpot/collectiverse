### CANCEL

`CANCEL` allows the seller to cancel a listing. For auctions, the seller can cancel the listing that has not received a bid. For 'buy now' deals, the seller can cancel the listing at any time. After cancellation, the listed NFT will be transferred from the escrow account to the seller's account. The `CANCEL` button becomes clickable when auctions or 'buy now' deals meet these conditions. The `CANCEL` button is located under the `OWNED` tab for your owned tokens on the profile page.
