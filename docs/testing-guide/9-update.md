### UPDATE

`UPDATE` allows you to reflect your owned NFTs. Your owned NFTs currently are not update automatically, but you can update them by clicking the `UPDATE` button. The `UPDATE` button is located under the `OWNED` tab on the profile page. Clicking the `UPDATE` button allows you to update the tokens owned and minted in the CollectiVerse. An optional box is provided for inputting the NFT address from which you want to import tokens minted from an external source. Owned tokens are not loaded automatically but manually by clicking the `UPDATE` button.
