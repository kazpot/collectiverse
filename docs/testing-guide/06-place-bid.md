### PLACE BID

`PLACE BID` allows you to participate in the auction of an NFT and place a bid price which must be greater than the minimum price. The `PLACE BID` button on the product page enables the buyer to place a bid on the NFT with a specified price. The buyers can submit a bid to any auction listing that has not yet expired or been canceled. When a buyer submits a valid bid, the amount bid is transferred to an escrow account. If a buyer is outbid, their bid amount is refunded from the escrow account. The winning buyer will receive the NFT from the escrow account.
